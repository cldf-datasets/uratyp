**Can standard negation be asymmetric in the present tense?**

Standard negation stands for the negation of the declerative verbal main clauses. Distinction can be made between symmetric and asymmetric negation. Whereas in the case of symmetric negation the affirmative and negative clause only differs by the negative marker, asymmetric negation differs in other ways too, e.g. negation may affect the finiteness of verbal elements, marking of grammatical categories, reality status of events etc. (Miestamo 2013) Both systems can also co-occur in a language. For example, in Livonian, the 1st and 2nd plural forms only differ in terms of the negative marker (= symmetric negation), while the singular forms also reveal differences in person marking (= asymmetric negation) (Metslang et al. 2015: 435); cf. examples (a) and (b). The aim of this question is to examine the presence of asymmetric standard negation in the present tense.

>Livonian<br/>
>a. *ma **lugū-b** :  ma **äb lu’g***<br/>
>I read-1SG  :  I NEG.PRS.1SG read.CNG<br/>
>‘I read’ : ‘I don’t read’
>
>b. *mēg **lu’gg-õm** : mēg **äb lu’gg-õm***<br/>
>we read-1PL    : we NEG.1PL read-1PL<br/>
>‘we read’ : ‘we don’t read’

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if in the present tense the standard negation is asymmetric in at least some part of the negative paradigm (as is the case with Livonian). The answer is '0' if in the present tense the standard negation can only be symmetric.
