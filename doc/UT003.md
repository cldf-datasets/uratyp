**Can finite verbs agree in number with the nominal object?**

There are languages like Hungarian that index the P argument on the verb. In addition, it is possible for a language to explicitly mark the number of the object on the main verb, as in Tundra Nenets (1). This question maps languages, where such agreement is possible.

>1SG *meə-w°*, 2DU *me°-mih*, 1PL *me°-waq* (< *me*- ‘to take, to do’; the ending depends on the number of the object)

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if there is a way to mark the number of the object on the main verb. If no such distinction can be made, the value is '0'. For instance, in Hungarian, irrespective of the number of the object the personal ending in 1Sg is *-m*:
