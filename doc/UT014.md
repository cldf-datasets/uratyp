**Can S and A be conflated morphologically across clause boundaries, i.e. act as syntactic pivot?**

"If two clauses within a complex sentence have an argument in common, a syntactic pivot may determine which co-referetial participants within a sentence can be ellipsed, and which not" (Aikhenvald 2015: 257). If S (= subject in the intransitive sentence) and A (=subject in the transitive sentence) can be conflated, the language has an 'accusative' pivot (cf. UT015). This is true for Estonian (1), where Ø can only be understood to refer to A and not to O (i.e. it was the thief and not the woman who run away).

>*Varas* (**A**) *lõ-i   nais-t* (**O**)  *ja*  Ø (**S**) *jooks-is  ära*<br/>
>thief  hit-PST.3SG woman-PRT and run-PST.3SG away<br/>
>‘The thief hit the woman and ran away’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the shared argument that is omitted functions as S (=subject of the intransitive clause) or A (=subject of the transitive clause).
