**Can the same coordinating conjunction be used for NPs, VPs, and clauses?** 

Coordination is used to mean joining syntactic constructions of the same type into larger units. This may be done by simply placing two units next to each other (juxtaposition) or by applying a linker or a coordinator (Velupillai 202: 318). This question asks whether it is possible to use the same coordinator for conjunctive coordination (i.e. 'and'-coordination) for NPs, VPs, and clauses, as in example (1).

>*Anna **és** Péter* ‘Anna and Peter’<br/>
>*Péter olvas **és** tanul* ‘Peter is reading and studying’<br/>
>*Péter olvas **és** Anna tanul* ‘Peter reading and Anna is studying'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the same coordinating conjunction can be used for NPs, VPs, and clauses. The answer is '0' if a different stategy (e.g juxtaposition - no conjunction) is used in at least one of the cases.
