**Is there case syncretism of location and source marking?**

Syncretism means that it possible for several case values to be expressed by a single form (Baerman 2009: 219). Although it is more common to encounter conflation between cases conveying goal and location (cf. UT089), syncretism between cases expressing location and source can also be attested (Creissels 2012), as in North Saami (1) and Livvi-Karelian (2):

(1) North Saami<br/>
>a. *Mun lea-n gávppi-**s***<br/>
>1SG be-1SG  groecery_store-LOC<br/>
>‘I am at a/the grocery store’

>b. *Mun boađá-n gávppi-**s***<br/>
>1SG come-1SG grocery_store-LOC<br/>
>‘I come from a/the grocery store’<br/>

(2) Livvi-Karelian<br/> 
>*lattie-**l***<br/> 
>floor-ADE/ABL<br/> 
>‘on the floor, from the floor’

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if syncretism between location and source marking characterises at least one set of cases (i.e. the expression of external, internal, or proximity relations). If syncretism in impossible/uncommon, the answer is '0'.
