**Is there radical qualitative consonant gradation?**

Radical qualitative consonant gradation is an alternation in consonants, which depends on the (historical) openness or closeness of the second syllable. When the second syllable is closed, the consonant on the boundary of the first and second syllable is weakened, lost or replaced by a “weak” counterpart.
