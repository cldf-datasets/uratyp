**Is there a distinct category of dual for verbal agreement with a dual subject?**

Dual is a grammatical number category that refers to two entities. In the case of agreement, dual is also marked on the verb. Agreement may be consistent for varioys kinds of nouns (e.g. animate and inanimate nouns) and pronouns. In South Saami, there is dual agreement only with pronouns:

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>*Månnoeh luhkien*<br/>
>we.1DU read.1DU<br/>
>‘We two read'

In other instances, the plural form is used:<br/>
>(2) South Saami<br/>
>*Maanah låhkijägan*<br/>
>child.PL read.3DU<br/>
>‘Children read’ (= two or more)

>(3) South Saami<br/>
>*Göökte  gaahtoeh  byöpmedieh*<br/> 
>two      cat.PL    eat.3PL<br/>
>‘Two cats eat'

**Coding.** The value is ‘1’ if there is verbal agreement with dual subject in at least one of the possibilities mentioned above. The answer is ‘0’ if dual is marked only on the verb or only on the noun.</p>
