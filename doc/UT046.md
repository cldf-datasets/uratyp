**Is a copula needed for predicate nominals in the past and/or future tense?**

Predicate nominals typically involve the structure NP copula NP, where *copula* usually designates a verb, but it may also be an affix, or a particle that joins two nominal elements (Payne 1997: 115; Pustet 2003: 5). This question asks whether copula is needed in semantically marked occasions, i.e. in clauses with past and/or future time referece, as in example (1) (for clauses with present time reference, see UT045).

>‘This was/will be his daugther’s husband’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if copula is needed in clauses with past and/or future time reference. When answering the question only affirmative clauses were considered.
