**Are there participles that obligatorily agree with the nouns they modify in case and number (in all contexts)?**

This question asks whether there are participles that obligatorily agree with the noun they modify, as in (1).

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Puhuin eilen lähete-**ty-i-stä** kirje-**i-stä***<br/>
>speak-PST-1SG yesterday send-PTCP.PST-PL-ELA letter-PL-ELA<br/>
>‘I was speaking about the letters that were sent yesterday’<br/>

Here, all contexts is used to mean contexts where one would expect agreement also otherwise (e.g., in the case of adnominal modifiers), cf.:

(2) Finnish<br/>
>*uus-**i-sta** kirje-**i-stä***<br/>
>new-PL-ELA letter-PL-ELA<br/>
>'(about) new letters'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is at least one such participle, which obligatorily agrees in case and number with the noun it modifies in all contexts.
