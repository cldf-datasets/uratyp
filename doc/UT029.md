**Is there morphological marking on the verb dedicated to the expression of epistemic possibility?** 

Epistemic modality can be defined as “speaker’s evaluation of the likelihood of a state of affairs” (Nuyts 2001: xv). For instance, *Jane is probably/may be at work* can be analysed as follows: the speaker holds that the proposition Jane is at work is not certain but only a mere possibility, relative to what s/he knows or to his/her evidence.

>*Asia  ratken-**nee**  huomenna*<br/>

>‘The thing should be resolved tomorrow’ 

**Coding.** The value is '1' if epistemic possibility can be expressed using an inflectional or derivational means.
