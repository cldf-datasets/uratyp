**Does the numeral modification of a noun have an effect on its case selection?** 

Both cardinal as well as ordinal numerals modify a noun phrase. Whereas cardinal numerals express the number of referents denoted by the noun (*three books*), ordinal numerals convey their order in relatioh to other referents (*the third book*). They may also differ in their underlying (morpho)syntax. (Dryer 2007: 164) This question asks whether there are morphosyntactic differences between noun phrases containing a cardinal numeral. For example, the numeral 'one' requires the nominative case in Finnish, whereas the cardinal numerals bigger than 'one' take the partitive:

(1) Finnish<br/>
>*yksi ystävä :  kaksi ystävää*<br/> 
>one.NOM.SG friend.NOM.SG :  two.NOM.SG friend.PRT.SG<br/>
>‘one friend' : 'two friends’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if a cardinal numeral can influence the case selection of a noun. If there are no differences in the underlying morphosyntax the value is '0'.
