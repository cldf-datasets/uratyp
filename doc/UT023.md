**Can tense be expressed overtly on the negative marker?**

Languages in which a negative marker can take inflectional morphology (usually called *negative auxiliary*) differ with respect to grammatical categories expressed on the negative auxiliary and lexical verb (cf. also UT022). The aim of this question is to find out whether tense can be expressed on the negative auxiliary, as in South Saami (cf. 1a and 1b).

>(1) South Saami<br/>
>a. *Im lohkh*<br/>
>NEG.1SG read.CNG<br/>
>‘I do not read’

>b. *Idtjim lohkh*<br/>
>NEG.PST.1SG read.CNG<br/>
>‘I did not read’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if tense can be overtly expressed on the negative marker (negative auxiliary).
