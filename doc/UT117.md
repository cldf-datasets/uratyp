**Is there contrastive length of vowels?**

If there is a phonological opposition between short and long vowels in a language, the length of vowels changes the word meaning (see Finnish example). To compare, in Central Veps, the single vowel may sound long (e.g. suŕ ’big’), but there is no phonological contrast.

>tuli [ˈtu.liˑ] ‘fire’ vs. tuuli [ˈtuː.li] ‘wind’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the meaning of the word depends on the vowel length.
