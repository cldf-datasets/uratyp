**Are there two sets of local cases?**

Spatial case systems often show structuring along two dimensions. On the one hand, they make a distinction between **goal** (also called destination), **location**, and **source** (in more elaborate systems also path may be added). On the other hand, they convey relative orientations that can be associated with notions such as IN, ON, AT etc. (Creissels 2012). This question examines whether a language contains two sets of cases that reveal a tripartite distinction. For instance, a distinction can be made between internal vs. external local cases (see more in Kittilä and Ylikoski 2011), as in Finnish:

(1) Finnish<br/>
>a. Internal local cases:<br/> 
>*kori-**in*** (ILL) 'into the basket', *kori-**ssa*** (INE) 'in the basket', *kori-**sta*** (ELA) 'from inside the basket'<br/>
>b. External local cases:<br/> 
>*pöydä-**lle*** (ALL) 'onto the table', *pöydä-**llä*** (ADE) 'on the table', *pöydä-**ltä*** (ABL) 'from top of the table'

**Coding.** The answer is '1' if it is possible to distinguish between two sets of cases (even if there is some syncretism). The answer is '0' if only a series of unproductive endings with a closed set of words can be found.
