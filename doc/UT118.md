**Is there contrast between short and long unstressed vowels?**

If there is a phonological contrast between short and long vowels in unstressed syllable in a language, the length of unstressed vowels changes the word meaning, as in Finnish.

>Finnish<br/>
>kiven [ˈki.ven] stone.GEN.SG vs. kiveen [ˈki.veːn] stone.ILL.SG

**Coding.** The value is '1' if the (grammatical) meaning of the word depends on the length of the vowel in an unstressed syllable.
