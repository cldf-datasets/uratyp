**Are there palatalized labials and velars?**

In some languages, palatalized labial and velar consonants (e.g. /pʲ, vʲ, mʲ, kʲ/) contrast with plain labial and velar consonants (non-palatalized labials and velars) on the phonological level, e.g. the word's meaning depends on the palatalization or non-palatalization of labials and velars.

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a phonological opposition between palatalized labials and velars (e.g. /pʲ, mʲ, kʲ/) and non-palatalized labials and velars in the core vocabulary.
