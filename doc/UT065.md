**Are there nonfinite forms that can be used both as participles and converbs without any additional morphological material, such as case markers?**

Nonfinite forms can be used in various functions, including as converbs. A converb can be defined as "a nonfinite verb form whose main function is to mark adverbial subordination"; whereas participles could be regarded as verbal adjectives, converbs could be seen as verbal adverbs (Haspelmath 2020: 3). This question asks whether one and the same nonfinite form can be used in both functions. In the literature, converbs may be subsumed under different labels, e.g. in Udmurt they are called gerunds.

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a nonfinite form that can function both as a participle and as a converb without any additional morphological material.
