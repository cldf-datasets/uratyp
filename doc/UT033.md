**Is it common to use the imperative/jussive in complement clauses introduced by predicates expressing wish/desire/will?** 

Complement clauses introduced by verbs of different semantic types (e.g. 'want', 'order', 'see' etc.) may also require different marking on the verb in the complement clause. The aim of this question is to find outh whether imperative/jussive marking is possible in complement clauses introduced by verbs conveying 'wish', 'want', or related meanings, as in example (1). (Instead of *imperative/jussive* also the terms *subjunctive* or *conjunctive* may be used.)

>'S/he doesen't want us to come out from the water.'

**Coding.** The value is '1' if imperative/jussive marking can appear in the complement clause introduced by predicates expressing wish, desire or will.
