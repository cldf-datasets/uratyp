**Is there morphological marking for irrealis (e.g. hypothetical state of affairs)?**

It is possible to distinguish between events that have actualised (*realis*) and events that can only be imagined or wished for (*irrealis*) (Mithun 1995). This question asks whether morphological marking is used to encode events regarded as nonactualised; see conditional marking used in example (1). (Various terms may be used, e.g. *conditional*, *conjunctive*, *subjunctive*.)

**Coding.** The value is '1' if morphological marking is used to denote events regarded as nonactualised.<br/>
