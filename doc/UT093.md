**Is there a separate case for marking the means by which something is carried out (instrumental) and/or accompaniement (comitative)?**

This question maps whether there is a case that primarily expresses instrumental and/or comitative function. To exemplify, in Estonian the comitative case can be used in both functions (1). In Finnish, in turn, there is a separate case marker (only combines with the plural root) to convey the instrumental function (2).

>(1) Estonian<br/> 
>a. *lusika-**ga*** (instrumental function)<br/>
>spoon-COM<br/>
>‘with a spoon’<br/>

>b. *lapse-**ga*** (comitative function)</br>
>child-COM<br/>
>‘with a child’</br>

>(2) Finnish<br/>
>*Hän kirjoitti kyn-i-**ne**-en*(instrumental function)<br/>
>3SG write.PST.3SG pen-PL-COM-POSS.3<br/>
>‘He wrote with a pen.’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a case marker that has at least one of the above mentioned functions as the primary function. The value is '0' if the comitative and/or instrumental meaning is a secondary meaning of some other case.
