**Is there a grammatical device for progressivity?**

The progressive views the situation “as ongoing at a single point in time, but it does not exhaustively localize the event” (Bertinetto et al. 2000: 527). Historically, progressives often have locative sources, and development into progressives has involved erosion of the locative meaning (e.g. Bybee et al. 1994). This question asks whether a language contains a dedicated means to express progressivity. Finnish and South Saami use a periphrastic construction that consists of an auxiliary 'be' + a non-finite verb form (in South Saami, the auxiliary verb may be dropped):

>(1) Finnish<br/>
>*Ole-n luke-ma-ssa*<br/>
>be-1SG read-SUP-INE<br/>
>‘I am reading’

>(2) South Saami<br/> 
>*Manne Staaresne årroeminie*<br/>
>1SG Staare.INE live.PROG<br/> 
>‘I am living in Östersund’

**Coding.** The value is '1' if there is a grammatical device that can be associated with the expression of progressivity. The value is '1' even if in some contexts the respective device may appear in a locative meaning.
