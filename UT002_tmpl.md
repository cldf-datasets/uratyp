It is common for a verb to agree in number with the nominal subject. However, instances of non-agreement may also turn out to be possible:

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT002-1)

## Coding

The value is '1' if non-agreement can be attested. The value is '0' if non-agreement only involves agreement between a predicate and a quantity phrase acting as a nominal subject (2) and/or coordinated items (3).
