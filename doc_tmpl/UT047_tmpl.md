Locative predicates are a type of nonverbal predicates used to convey location ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:dryer_np1_2007)). 
A locative predicate involves a locative adverbial phrase that usually is a noun (or a prepositional) phrase or a clause with locational meaning. The aim of this question is to find out whether locative predicates can occur without a copula, as in example (1).

## Coding.

 The value is '1' if locative adverbial phrases can be attested without a copula (usually a 'be'-verb), as in South Saami example (1). In the case locative predicates typically require a copula, as in Finnish example (2), the value is '0'.
