Spatial case systems often show structuring along two dimensions. On the one hand, they make a distinction between 
**goal** (also called destination), **location**, and **source** (in more elaborate systems also path may be added). 
On the other hand, they convey relative orientations that can be associated with notions such as IN, ON, AT etc. 
([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:creissels_2012)). This question examines whether a language contains two sets of cases that reveal a tripartite 
distinction. For instance, a distinction can be made between internal vs. external local cases 
(see more in [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:kittilae_and_ylikoski_2011)), as in Finnish:

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1a&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT091-1a)

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1b&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT091-1b)

## Coding

The answer is '1' if it is possible to distinguish between two sets of cases (even if there is some syncretism). The answer is '0' if only a series of unproductive endings with a closed set of words can be found.
