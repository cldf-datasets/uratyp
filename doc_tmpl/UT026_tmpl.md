It is possible to distinguish between events that have actualised (*realis*) and events that can only be imagined or 
wished for (*irrealis*) ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:mithun_irreality_1995)). This question asks whether morphological marking is used to encode events regarded as nonactualised; see conditional marking used in example (1). (Various terms may be used, e.g. *conditional*, *conjunctive*, *subjunctive*.)
