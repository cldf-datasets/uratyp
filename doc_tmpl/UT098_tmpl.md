The noun phrase in question is usually a recipient-like argument of the sentence. In Enets, for instance, there is a 
special benefactive construction, which consists of a specific suffix (usually called the *destinative*) followed by a 
possessive suffix that in transitive clauses is attached to the direct object ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:khanina_rare_2014): 1391-1392):

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a dedicated nominal inflection for expressing benefactive/destinative semantics, which is different from the dative marker. The answer is '0' if there is no dedicated marker or a postpositional construction has to be used (see 'for you' in English translation).
