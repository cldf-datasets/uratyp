Syncretism means that it possible for several case values to be expressed by a single form ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:baerman_syncretism_2009): 219). 
Although it is more common to encounter conflation between cases conveying goal and location (cf. UT089), syncretism 
between cases expressing location and source can also be attested ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:creissels_2012)), as in North Saami (1) and Livvi-Karelian (2):

[](ExampleTable?example_id=2&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT090-2)

## Coding

The answer is '1' if syncretism between location and source marking characterises at least one set of cases (i.e. the expression of external, internal, or proximity relations). If syncretism in impossible/uncommon, the answer is '0'.
