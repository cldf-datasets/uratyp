# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT031)

A command addressed to a singular 2nd person can be regarded as a canonical imperative, but commands can also be 
addressed to other persons ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:aikhenvald_art_2015): 234). The aim of this question is to find out whether it is 
possible to mark an indirect command addressed to a singular 3rd person using a specific mood, as in (1) and (2) 
(cf. also UT032). (The respective forms are usually called *jussive*, *optative* or *imperative*.)

## Coding.

 The value is '1' if a specific marking different from the indicative appears on the verb to convey an indirect command to the 3Sg.
