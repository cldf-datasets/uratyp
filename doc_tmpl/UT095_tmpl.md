The essive typically denotes a temporary location or state of being (e.g., "as a child"), whereas translastive is used 
to express change in state (“becoming X” or “change to X") ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:degroot_2017): 6). 
This question investigates whether there is a separate case used to encode at least one of these functions. To exemplify, in South Saami, there is one case (the essive) found in both functions, whereas in Finnish there are two separate cases (the essive and translative).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a separate case encoding at least one of the functions mentioned above. Thus, both South Saami and Finnish are coded as '1'. The value is '0' if the expression of the result of change and/or state of being is only a secondary function of some other case (e.g. local case).
