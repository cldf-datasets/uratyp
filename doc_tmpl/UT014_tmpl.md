If S (= subject in the intransitive sentence) and A (=subject in the transitive sentence) can be conflated, the language 
has an 'accusative' pivot (cf. UT015 for ergative pivot). This is true for Estonian (1), where Ã˜ can only be understood 
to refer to A and not to O (i.e. it was the thief and not the woman who run away).

## Coding

The value is '1' if the shared argument that is omitted functions as S (=subject of the intransitive clause) or A (=subject of the transitive clause).
