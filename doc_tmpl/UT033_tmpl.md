Complement clauses introduced by verbs of different semantic types (e.g. 'want', 'order', 'see' etc.) may also require a specific marking on the verb in the complement clause. The aim of this question is to find out whether imperative/jussive marking occurs in complement clauses introduced by verbs conveying 'wish', 'want', or related meanings (see example 1). (Instead of *imperative/jussive* also the terms *subjunctive* or *conjunctive* may be used.)

## Coding

The value is '1' if imperative/jussive marking can appear in the complement clause introduced by predicates expressing wish, desire or will.
