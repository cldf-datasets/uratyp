The frequentative views the situation as being frequent during a certain period of time. Thus, it also includes the habitual meaning as the situation is characteristic to a certain period of time (cf. UT016). The aim of this question is to find out whether frequentativity can be expressed by other than lexical means. For instance, in Mansi and Hungarian, a derivational suffix is used:

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT017-1)

[](ExampleTable?example_id=2&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT017-2)

## Coding

The value is '1' if the expression of frequentativity can be clearly attributed to a grammatical device.
