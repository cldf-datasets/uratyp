# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT096)

The aim of this question is to find out whether there is a separate case for the expression of state of being (usually 
called *the essive*), which is different from the case typically used to mark transition (see also UT095). In Finnish, 
for instance, these two meanings are encoded by different cases, called the essive (1a) and the translative (1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a separate case for the expression of state of being (as in Finnish).
