**Is there differential subject marking?**

In addition to differential object marking (see UT010-UT012), languages may also show differential subject marking (DSM). 
In a broad sense, already a different case of a subject, or a different agreement or position of a subject counts as DSM; 
in a narrower sense, such differences ought to depend on the features of the subject in some way or other to be regarded 
as DSM ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:woolford_2009): 17). In Estonian, the nominative case may be used for identification or conveying a definite amount 
of something (1a), whereas the partitive case may be used to express an indefinite amount of something (1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if subject marking varies under certain conditions. When answering the question, only finite clauses were considered.
