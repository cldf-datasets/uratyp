# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT062)

This question asks whether there are participles that obligatorily agree with the noun they modify, as in (1).

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT062-1)

Here, all contexts is used to mean contexts where one would expect agreement also otherwise (e.g., in the case of adnominal modifiers), cf.:

[](ExampleTable?example_id=2&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT062-2)

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is at least one such participle, which obligatorily agrees in case and number with the noun it modifies in all contexts.
