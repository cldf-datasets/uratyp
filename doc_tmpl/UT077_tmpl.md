Case compounding is usually understood as attachment of multiple case markers to a noun stem that make up a phonological 
word. A type of case compounding is case-stacking, when independently occurring case affixes are used to describe a 
complex trajectory, typically expressing combination of the meanings of the two affixe, as in example (1).

## Coding

The value is '1' if at least two case markers can be attached to the noun. The prerequisite is that the examples contain proper case endings.
