There may be verbs that do not require any verbal arguments (such as a subject or an object) but can form sentences on 
their own. This is often attested with verbs expressing environmental conditions ('to rain', 'to be cold' etc.):

## Coding

The value is '1' if there are avalent verbs, i.e. verbs that do not need any arguments. The value is '0' if each clause needs a subject, including the so-called dummy subject or expletive subject (such as *it* in the translations above).
