Predicate nominal clauses typically express equation (*He is my father*) and proper inclusion (*He is a teacher*). 
The term *copula* designates a verb (e.g. *be* in example 1), an affix, or a particle that joins two nominal elements 
and functions as the predicate nucleus ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:payne_1997): 115; [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:pustet_2003): 5). 
The aim of this question is to find out whether predicate nominal clauses typically involve the structure NP copula NP 
when used for the present time reference (1) (cf. also UT046 for past and/or future time reference).

## Coding

The value is '1' if copula is needed/commonly used in the simplest predicate nominal constructions, i.e. the present tense. When answering the question, only 3sg forms of the present tense were considered.
