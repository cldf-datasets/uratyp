It is common for affixes to occur in a fixed order, however, it is by no means universal. Still, multiple orders do 
not necessarily have consequences for meaning ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:lieber_and_stekauer_2014): 376). 
The possessive suffix and the case suffix may be ordered in one way or the other, cf. Hungarian 
*kutya-m-nak* (px + case) vs. Finnish *koira-lle-ni* (case + px) â€˜to my dog'. Still, in both languages their 
order is fixed meaning that in Hungarian the possessive suffix always precedes the case suffix and in Finnish it 
always follows the case suffix. To compare, in Udmurt, there is variation in the ordering of the two suffixes 
depending on the case, e.g. with terminative and dative the possessive suffix comes before the case suffix, whereas 
in the illative and prolative it follows the case suffix ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:kelmakov_udmurtin_2008): 77).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is no variation in the ordering of the possessive suffix and the case suffix, i.e. one of them precedes the other in all contexts (as in Hungarian adn Finnish). The value is '0' if there are variations (as in Udmurt).
