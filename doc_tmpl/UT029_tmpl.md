Epistemic modality can be defined as 

> “speaker’s evaluation of the likelihood of a state of affairs” ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:nuyts_2001): xv). 

For instance, *Jane is probably/may be at work* can be analysed as follows: the speaker holds that the proposition Jane 
is at work is not certain but only a mere possibility, relative to what s/he knows or to his/her evidence.
