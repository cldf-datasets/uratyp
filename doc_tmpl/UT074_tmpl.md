# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT074)

The superlative is used to express the highest quality or degree. A synthetic superlative can be found in Finnish, 
where a superlative affix is attached to the stem:

## Coding

The answer is '1' if a language has a synthetic means to express the highest quality or degree. The answer is '0' if 
the only option is to use an analytic construction. E.g. in Erzya, the respective construction is formed by using 
*ve≈õe* 'all' in the ablative case followed by an adjective or an adverb in the nominative ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:aasmae_2012)).
