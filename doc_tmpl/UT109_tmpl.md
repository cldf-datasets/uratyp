Personal pronouns are used to express the so-called grammatical persons in singular and plural 
(e.g. Estonian *mina* 'I' - 1st person singular, *sina* 'you' - 2nd person singular, *tema* 's/he' - 
3rd person singular etc.). As regards 3rd person pronouns, a language may have a distinct personal pronoun 
(such as Estonian *tema* 's/he') but also a demonstrative stem may be found in this function (see [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:bhat_wals_2013) 
for different types of connections between 3rd person pronouns and demonstratives). For instance, in colloquial 
Estonian *see* 'this/that/it' may be used for 3rd person singular human referent, though often with negative connotation:

## Coding

The value is '1' if a demonstrative stem may be used for 3rd person human referent (even if it is only characteristic of colloquial language). The value is '0' if only a personal pronoun can be found in this function.
