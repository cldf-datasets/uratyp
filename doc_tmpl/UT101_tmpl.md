Attributive construstions (also called *phrasal possession*) consist of a possessor and possessee, which can be used to 
express wide range of meanings, e.g. physical and abstract possession (cf. *my cup* vs. *my thoughts*), inalienable 
possession (*my eyes*), permanent and temporary possession,  part-whole relations etc. ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:heine_possession_2006)). 
This question examines, whether there is more than one option to mark the possessor in such attributive constructions. 
In Udmurt, for instance, the possessor can commonly occur in the genitive (1a), nominative (1b), and ablative case (1c). 
Differences in coding may have different grounds. In Udmurt, the nominative case tends to be used with inalienable or 
indefinite possession, whereas the ablative marking is conditioned by syntactic factors - it appears when the possessor 
functions as a direct object (1c) (see [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:edygarova_2009)).

## Coding

The value '1', if there is more than one option to code the possessor in the attributive construction. The value is '0' if there is only one general pattern, or if alternative marking is possible but only in limited/lexicalized instances.
