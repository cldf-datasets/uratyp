This question maps whether there is a case that primarily expresses instrumental and/or comitative function. To 
exemplify, in Estonian the comitative case can be used in both functions (1). In Finnish, in turn, there is a separate 
case marker (only combines with the plural root) to convey the instrumental function (2).

[](ExampleTable?example_id=2&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT093-2)

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a case marker that has at least one of the above mentioned functions as the primary function. 
The value is '0' if the comitative and/or instrumental meaning is a secondary meaning of some other case.
