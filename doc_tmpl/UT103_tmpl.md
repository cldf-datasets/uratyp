Possessive affixes attached to the head noun (the possessee) indicate the person/number of the possessor, e.g. in 
Finnish *omena-ni* (1SG) 'my apple', *omena-si* (2SG) 'your apple'. However, the number of items possessed can also 
be shown morphologically. Whereas in Finnish, *omenani* and *omenasi* can also mean 'my apples' and 'your apples' 
respectively, in Hungarian the plural marker is attached to refer to multiple items (2). An even more elaborate system 
can be found in Mansi, which distinguishes between singular, dual, and plural numbers, and this is also relevant when 
conveying the number of possessees.

## Coding

The value is '1' if the number of items  possessed can be clearly distinguished, i.e. there is a distinction between singular vs. plural (1) or singular vs. dual vs. plural (2). The answer is '0' if no such distinction cannot be made (as in Finnish) or if there are no possessive suffixes in a language (absense of possessive suffixes is stated in the comments section).
