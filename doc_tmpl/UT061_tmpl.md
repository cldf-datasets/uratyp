This question asks whether the subject in participial subordinate clauses can be iencoded the same way as the subject of independent clauses. For instance, in example (1) Anna occurs in the nominative case (as is typical to subjects in independent clauses in Hungarian).

In Hungarian another possibility is to use a non-core participant containing the postposition *által*, e.g. *Anna  által* 'by Anna'. 

## Coding

The value is '1' if at least some participial subordinate clauses show the same kind of marking as in independent clauses. The value is '0' if the only option to express a subject in subordinate clauses is to use a certain non-core participant (cf. *által* above).
