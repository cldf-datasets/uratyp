To compare, in Finnish a directional case followed by an adposition has to be used to convey the respective meanings (e.g. *kotiin asti* 'until home'). 

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a separate case to express a limit in space or time as in Hungarian. If this can be regarded as a secondary function of some other case or the respective meaning is conveyed by an adpositional construction, the value is '0'.
