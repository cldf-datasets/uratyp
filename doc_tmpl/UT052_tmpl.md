A language may contain a particle, suffix or some other negative marker that only appears with non-finite forms, i.e. 
it cannot negate finite verbs. In Beserman Udmurt, the present participle in *-š’* and non-past participle in *-no* 
are negated by a regular adjectival negative marker *-tem* (“a derivative suffix with caritive meaning” according to 
[](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:edygarova_2015): 278), while the past participle in *-m* is negated with a specialized participial negative marker 
*‑te*. Both of these markers count as special non-finite negators. In Estonian, there is a special negator *mitte*, 
which is used to negate non-finite forms (1a), while *ei* is used in standard negation (cf. 1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a special negative marker that is compatible with non-finite forms. Markers of non-finite forms that are inherently negative (i.e. cannot be analysed as a combination of two separate markers) were not considered.
