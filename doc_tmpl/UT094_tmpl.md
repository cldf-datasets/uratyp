The aim of this question is to find out whether there are different means to express accompaniment ("in the company of") and the instrumental function ("using, by means of") (cf. UT093). To exemplify, in Komi-Zyrian, there is a separate comitative case (1a) and instrumental case (1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a separate case marker denoting accompaniment. In order to be coded as '1' the language also has to contain a separate instrumental case.
