The aim of this questions is to find out whether there is a negative participle, which cannot be analyzed as a 
combination of a specific participial marker and a negation marker. Such participle can be found in Northern Khanty 
(see *-li* in example 1), which is also neutral as regards temporal and aspectual characteristics associated wuth two 
affirmative participles in the language (see [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:shagal_overview_2018): 78).

## Coding

The value is '1' if a language contains a specialized negative participle. If there is no such participle and participial clauses are negated simply using a negative marker (as in example 2), the value is '0'.
