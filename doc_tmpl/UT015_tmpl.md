Apart from languages where S and A can be conflated across clause boundaries (cf. UT014) there are also languages that 
can combine S (= subject in the intransitive sentence) and P (= object in the transitive sentence), which implies an 
'ergative' pivot (see [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:aikhenvald_art_2015): 258). East Mansi reveals such possibility:

## Coding

The value is '1' if S and P can be conflated (as in 1). The value is '0' if the shared argument that is omitted functions as S or A (cf. UT014).
