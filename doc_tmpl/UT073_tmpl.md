Most adjectives have two positions, i.e. they can be used attributively (e.g. *tall boy*) and predicatively 
(e.g. *the boy is tall*). When positioned after a noun, the adjective may be preceded by a copula but not necessarily; 
it is also possible that the morphological marking of adjectives in the two contexts differs

This question examines whether it is common for adjectives occurring in the predicative position to agree with the 
head noun in number, as in Hungarian (1) and Estonian (2).

## Coding

The answer is '1' if it is common for core adjectives used predicatively to agree with the subject noun in number. The answer is '0' if there is no agreement.
