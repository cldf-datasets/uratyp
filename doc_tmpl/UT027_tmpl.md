Counterfactuality may be defined as “fictitious creation of a possible world which does not correspond to the actual 
world and therefore is “contrary to fact” (*I wish I had a car*)”. Counterfactuality may be expressed in connection 
with past, present, and future. In all cases, the antecedent is contrary to fact, false, or unlikely. This question 
investigates whether verbs in counterfactual conditional clauses are marked in a specific mood (terms *conditional*, 
*irrealis* may be used). For example, Finnish (1) and Nganasan (2) reveal conditional marking:

## Coding

The value is '1' if verbs are marked in a specific mood in counterfactual conditional clauses, i.e. in the protasis part of the sentence (typically contains the particle 'if').
