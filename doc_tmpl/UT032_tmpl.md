In addition to commands addressed to a singular 2nd person it is also possible to direct commands to other persons (see also UT031). This question asks whether there is specific morphological marking on the verb expressing a command adressed to a singular 1st person, as in example (1). (The respective forms are usually called *jussive*, *optative*, *imperative* or *hortative*.)

## Coding

The value is '1' if specific marking is used on the verb to direct a command to the 1Sg. In other cases the value is '0', for instance, if a particle fulfils this function.
