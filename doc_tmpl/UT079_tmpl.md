Both cardinal as well as ordinal numerals modify a noun phrase. Whereas cardinal numerals express the number of 
referents denoted by the noun (*three books*), ordinal numerals convey their order in relatioh to other referents 
(*the third book*). They may also differ in their underlying (morpho)syntax ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:dryer_np2_2007): 164).
This question asks whether there are morphosyntactic differences between noun phrases containing a cardinal numeral. 
For example, the numeral 'one' requires the nominative case in Finnish, whereas the cardinal numerals bigger than 'one' take the partitive:

## Coding

The value is '1' if a cardinal numeral can influence the case selection of a noun. If there are no differences in the 
underlying morphosyntax the value is '0'.
