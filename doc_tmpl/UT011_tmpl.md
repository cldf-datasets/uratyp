Although differential object marking (DOM) is generally based on hierarchies reflecting certain characteristics of an object 
(such as animacy, topicality, definiteness; see UT010), there are also languages that use DOM to convey aspectual nuances 
(e.g. perfectivity vs. imperfectivity) ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:malchukov_and_dehoop_2011)). In Estonian, 
the partitive object tends to receive imperfcetive/unbounded interpretation (1a), whereas the genitive object gets 
perfective/bounded interpretation (1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if differences in object marking are based on differences in conveying aspectual information. The answer is '1' even if there are some restrictions, e.g. in Erzya, the definite conjugation can be associated with perfectivity/future and the indefinite conjugation with imperfectivity/present, although this does not apply to verbs expressing state and perception. When answering the question, only finite forms were considered.
