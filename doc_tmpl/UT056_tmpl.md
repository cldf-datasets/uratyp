# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT056)

A participle may be used to relativize only one specific participant of the situation (i.e. only S/A, P or S/P; see UT055), 
but there are also participles that can relativize all core participants as well as some noncore participants 
([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:shagal_participles_2017): 1-3). To exemplify, Hill Mari *-šašlə̑k* cannot relativize any particular participant but it can be used 
in a wide variety of contexts including in relativization of locatives ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:shagal_overview_2018)).

In some languages, the relevant forms may be referred to as nominalizations or converbs. 

## Coding
