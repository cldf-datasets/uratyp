A clause minimally consists of one predicate; the number of arguments depends on the predicate. The aim of this question 
is to find out whether an infinitive form can appear as the only predicate in an independent clause. This is possible in Estonian, where an infinitive can be used to express evidential meaning.

## Coding

The value is '1' if an infinitive can be used in an independent clause (main clause) to form a predicate. Although infinitives together with participles and converbs can be regarded as non-finite forms, this question only asks about infinitives.
