# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT067)

The aim of this question is to find out whether it is possible to place an object between the negative marker and the 
main verb in imperative constructions. Whereas this can occur in Estonian (1), it is uncommon in Udmurt (cf. 2).

## Coding

The value is '1' if an object can intervene the negative marker and the main verb, even if this makes the sentence pragmatically unneutral.
