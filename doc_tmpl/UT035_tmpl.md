In the case of a reflexive conjugation an action refers back to an agent performing the action. A language may contain 
a separate paradigm of verb affixes used to convey this function, as in Veps (cf. 1a and 1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if reflexive conjugation is available in various persons and it differs from non-reflexive conjugation (as in Veps). If a language only contains a derivational suffix, the value is '0'. For example, in Mari the derivational suffix *-alt* precedes the personal suffixes and it remains the same throughout the paradigm. Thus, the value is '0'.
