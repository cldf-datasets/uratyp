A noun can appear in the singular form to denote paired body parts or clothing/accessories that accompany them (1). 
This may be true even for languages with dual number, such as South Saami (2). To denote one member of the pair, 
the word for ‘half’ is typically used.

## Coding

The answer is '1' if in at least one of the instances (paired body parts/clothing/accessories) it is possible to use a singular form (see examples 1 and 2). The answer is '0' if there are no such instances or the singular form can only be associated with lexicalized forms, adverial or postpositional usages. For instance, *käes* in Estonian example (3) is used as a postposition.
