Canonical function of the 2nd person singular forms is to refer to the addressee. However, they may also receive 
generic interpretation when used without any specific 2nd person addressee is mind. There are instances that are 
unambiguously generic as otherwise the interpretation would literally be wrong, while other sentences allow for 
several interpretations ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:gast_et_al_2015): 148-149). 
Although without broader context the Veps example (1) could be directed to the addressee, the 2Sg forms are also 
attested in the generic function ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:grunthal_vepsan_2015): 125).
