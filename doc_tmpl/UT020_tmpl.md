A language may contain more than one means to express future time reference. There may also be a separate device for 
expressing immediate future ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:bybee_et_al_1994)). In the case of immediate 
future, a situation can be viewed as about to take place. In Estonian, a periphrastic device is used to encode this (1), 
whereas in Nganasan, there is a resultative inflection (2).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a grammatical device (either inflectional or periphrastic), which can be used to express an action that is about to happen (regardless of other possible functions the device may have). We did not count as '1' instances of a lexical verb used in the past tense form to convey an immediate activity (e.g. Estonian *Läksime!* go.PST.1PL ‘Off we go!’, cf. Russian *пошли*).
