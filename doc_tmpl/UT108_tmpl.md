Relative clauses may be introduced by a pronoun. This question asks whether there is an interrogative pronoun, which 
is primarily used for animates ('who'), that can also function as a relative pronoun referring to inanimates. For 
instance, the South Estonian *ki√§* 'who' can be found in such a function:

## Coding

The value is '1' if the interrogative pronoun 'who' functions as a relative pronoun and it can be used with inanimates. The answer is '0' if the respective pronoun cannot be used this way or a different pronoun (or 'what') is used instead.
