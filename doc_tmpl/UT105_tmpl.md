Possessive suffixes may also be found in a non-possessive function, such as the expression of definiteness 
(see also UT104). This question asks, whether 3Sg possessive suffixes can be used to convey definiteness. 
For example, in Nganasan, the 3Sg possessive suffix is used to definiteness of celestial bodies and natural 
phenomena if the entity is a planet or it is topicalized ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:wagner-nagy_grammar_2018): 174).

## Coding

The value is '1' if a 3Sg possessive suffix can be used to mark definiteness. The answer is '0' if no such function can be attested or if possessive suffixes are not present in a language.
