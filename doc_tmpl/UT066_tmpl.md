# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT066)

The aim of this question is to find out whether OV is the neutral order in affirmative imperative clauses, as in Udmurt: 

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT066-1)

## Coding

The value is '1' only in the case OV is the neutral order. In the case OV is possible but not neutral the value is '0'.
