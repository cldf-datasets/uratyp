Preverbs are preverbal morphemes that appear in front of a verb and form a close semantic unit with it; they tend to 
show syntactic mobility. Morphemes that function as preverbs typically also function as adverbs or adpositions. 
Preverbs may be used for perfectivization, aktionsart-formation, lexical word formation. (Preverbs may also be called *bounders*.)
