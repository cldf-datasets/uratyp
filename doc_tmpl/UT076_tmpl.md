Adpositions may express a distinction between goal (also called *destination of movement*), location, and source of 
movement (for case marking, see also UT090 and UT091). As conflation in systems of spatial adpositions is relatively 
common (especially of location and destination marking; see e.g. [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:creissels_2012)), this question only targets instances 
that reveal a tripartite system without there being syncretism, as in examples (1a-c):

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1a&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT076-1a)

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1b&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT076-1b)

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1c&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT076-1c)

## Coding

The answer is '1' if such a three-way distinction as in (1a-c) is possible at least with some adpositions. If no tripartite system can be attested, the answer is '0'.
