Languages in which a negative marker can take inflectional morphology (usually called *negative auxiliary*) differ with respect to grammatical categories expressed on the negative auxiliary and lexical verb (cf. also UT022). The aim of this question is to find out whether tense can be expressed on the negative auxiliary, as in South Saami (cf. 1a and 1b).
