Syncretism involves a "combination of multiple distinct case values in a single form", which results in an asymmetry 
between paradigms of a language; syncretism can occur in various parts of a paradigm ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:baerman_syncretism_2009): 219). 
This question examines whether there is syncretism between cases expressing goal and location. For instance in Veps, 
external and internal local cases reveal a tripartite system, whereas the expression of proximity shows syncretism (1). 
To compare, in Livonian, syncretism concerns the expression of external location (2).

## Coding

The answer is '1' if syncretism between goal and location marking characterises at least one set of cases (i.e. the expression of external, internal, or proximity relations). If syncretism in impossible/uncommon, the answer is '0'.
