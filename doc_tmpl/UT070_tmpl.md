Hypocoristic (also referred to as diminutive) forms are used to indicate attitudinal information about the affection of 
the speaker toward the referent. The aim of this question is to find out whether diminutive marking can be used on the 
verb. The respective reading may also referred to as *attenuative*. Usually, the diminutive marking on the verb gives 
the reading 'a little bit, for a while' (cf. Russia *po-*).
