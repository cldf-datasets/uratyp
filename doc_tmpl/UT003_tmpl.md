In addition to indexing the P argument on the verb a language may explicitly also mark the number of the object, as in Tundra Nenets (1). This question maps languages, where such agreement is possible.

>(1) Tundra Nenets (Nikolaeva 2014: 79)<br/>
>1SG *meə-w°*, 2DU *me°-mih*, 1PL *me°-waq* (< *me*- ‘to take, to do’; the ending depends on the number of the object)

## Coding

The value is ‘1’ if there is a way to mark the number of the object on the main verb. If no such distinction can be made, the value is '0'. For instance, in Hungarian, irrespective of the number of the object the personal ending in 1Sg is *-m*:
