Definiteness is primarily concerned with idetifiability of the referent expressed with a noun phrase in the ongoing 
discourse. It is often expressed by the lexical items (articles) but affixes also occur ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:lyons_1999)). 
One option is also to use possessive affixes, in which case they have a non-possessive meaning. 
This question asks weather 2Sg possessive suffixes can be used to mark definiteness (cf. also UT105), as in Forest Enets:

## Coding

The value is '1' if a 2Sg possessive suffix can be used to mark definiteness. The value is '0' if 2Sg possessive suffix does not have such a function or if possessive suffixes are not present in a language.
