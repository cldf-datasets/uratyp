The aim of the question is to find out whether modifiers of action nominalization can be marked like possessors in 
agent and patient roles. Estonian example in (1a) has two interpretations: the genitive-marked *poisi* can be 
understood as the agent or the patient (depending on the context). The genitive is also used for possessors (cf. 1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if possessors are marked the same way as modifiers of action nominalizations in agent and patient roles. The value is '1' also in the case of zero marking.
