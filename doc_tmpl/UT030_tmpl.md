Deontic possibility has to do with permission (e.g., *You may leave the hospital after a week*) and ability (e.g., *The children can swim across the lake*). This question asks, whether there is an inflectional or derivational marker, which can be used to convey these meanings. In Hungarian, the derivational suffix *-het/-hat* can be used to give permission (1) (additionally it functions as a marker of epistemic posisbility).

## Coding

The answer is '1' if there is a separate inflectional or derivational marker used to express ability and/or grant permission.
