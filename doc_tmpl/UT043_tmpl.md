A subordinate (or dependent) clause functions as a constituent of the main clause. Purposive clauses are a type of 
subordinate clauses used to express meanings like ‘in order to’, ‘so that’ etc. (1 and 2); a separate device may be 
used to introduce the clause (see *et* in example 2). Typically to adverbial clauses, purposive clauses function as 
adjuncts as they are not obligatory constituents of the clause. (The purposive clause may also be called *final clause*.)

## Coding

The value is '1' if it is possible to use a bare infinitive form (see 1 and 2) in the purposive subordinate clause.
