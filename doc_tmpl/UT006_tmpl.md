Subjects and objects are usually necessary to complete the meaning of a verb, which is why they are called *core arguments*. In languages that have cases, the distinction between subject and object is typically revealed by case marking. The aim of this question is to find out whether adpositions can also be used to mark them. For example, in Erzya, a postpositional construction can be used to express the object: 

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT006-1)

## Coding

The value is '1' if it is possible to use an adpositional construction to mark at least one of the core arguments (S, A, and/or P) and the respective usage is not an instance of government, i.e. when a particular verb requires a certain adpositonal construction. When answering the question, passive clauses were not considered.
