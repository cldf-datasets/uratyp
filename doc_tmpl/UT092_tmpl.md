Languages with a multitude of spatial cases tend to reveal a structured system. Typically, this means a combination of 
relative orientation and the distinction between **goal** (also called destination), **location**, and **source**. 
The relative orientation expressed by cases is usually limited to the notions that can be associated with IN, ON, and AT.

Whereas the aim of question UT091 is to find out whether there are at least two sets, this question examines whether 
three sets can be found. This is possible in Hungarian, which in addition to the external local cases (associated with 
ON; e.g., 1a) and internal local cases (associated with IN; e.g. 1b), contains the third set expressing proximity (AT):

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1a&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT092-1a)

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1b&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT092-1b)

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1c&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT092-1c)

## Coding

The answer is '1' if it is possible to distinguish between three sets of local cases (even if there is some syncretism). The answer is '0' if only a series of unproductive endings with a closed set of words can be found.
