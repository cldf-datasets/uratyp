Relative clauses may be introduced by a pronoun. This question asks, whether the interrogative pronoun 'who' can be 
used as a relative pronoun referring to animates other than humans. For instance, in Livonian example (1) *kis* 'who' is used for snakes:

## Coding

The value is '1' if an interrogative pronoun expressing 'who' also functions as a relative pronoun, which can be used with animates other than humans. The value is '0' if the respective pronoun does not have this function or a different pronoun is used instead.
