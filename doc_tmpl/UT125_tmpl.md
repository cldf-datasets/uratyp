Fixed primary stress means that the stress is always in the same position in a word. The primary stress can be fixed on 
the first syllable even if non-initial syllables comprise long vowels (see Finnish example). The primary stress may 
also be fixed on the last syllable of a word (as in Udmurt), or on any other position.
