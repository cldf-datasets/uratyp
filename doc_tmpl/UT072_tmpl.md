# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT072)

The aim of the question is to find out whether it is possible to use the same marking for the modifier of action 
nominalization in the patient role and for the direct object. In Estonian, the genitive case appears in both occasions (cf. 1a and 1b).

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1b&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT072-1b)

## Coding

The value is '1' if one and the same case can be used in both occasions (as in Estonian).
