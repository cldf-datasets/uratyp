The usage of case-marking for some objects and not for other objects is known as differential object marking (DOM). The aim of this question is to find out whether a language reveals differences in object marking conditioned by some characteristics (such as topicality, animacy, or definiteness) of an object. In Komi, for instance, definite inanimate objects may be unmarked (1a), whereas animate objects obligatorily take the accusative case (1b).

Cf. the prominency scale ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:aissen_2003)): 
 - Animacy scale: HUMAN > ANIMATE > INANIMATE
 - Definiteness scale: PERSONAL PRONOUN > PROPER NAME > DEFINITE NP > INDEFINITE SPECIFIC NP > NON-SPECIFIC NP
 
## Coding

The value is '1' if at least one of the characteristics of object referent causes differences in direct object marking. The value is '0' if case-marking  depends entirely on the type of a noun (e.g. in Khanty, only pronouns get accusative marking). When answering the question, only finite clauses were considered.
