The aim of this question is to find out whether the standard negation construction can also be used in non-finite dependent clauses. For instance in Hungarian, the negative marker *nem* can be used in both contexts (see 1a and 1b). 

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1a&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT051-1a)

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1b&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT051-1b)

To compare, the Estonian particle *ei* that is used to express standard negation is not compatible with non-finite clauses and *mitte* has to be used instead (see UT052). 

## Coding

The value is '1' if standard negation construction can also be used in non-finite dependent clauses (as in Hungarian). The answer is '0' if dependent non-finite clauses make use of a different negative marker or an entirely different negation construction is used.
