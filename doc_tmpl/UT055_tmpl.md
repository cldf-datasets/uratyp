Participles can be described on the basis of their capacity to relativize participants of the situation. Such 
participants include S (the single participant of the intransitive clause or the intransitive subject), 
A (the agent-like participant of the transitive clause), P (the patient-like participant of the transitive clause) 
and various oblique participants (locatives, instrumentals, etc.) (see [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:shagal_participles_2017)). 
This question asks whether there are participles that can relativize only one specific participant 
(i.e. only S/A, P or S/P) and be inherently oriented towards that specific participant. Such participles can 
be found in Finnish, where active participles are S/A-oriented, i.e. they relativize subjects (1a), whereas 
passive participles are P-oriented, i.e. they relativize objects (1b) ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:shagal_overview_2018): 65). 
There is no one participle that could do both (e.g. *luettu* cannot be used for 1a, nor can *lukeva* be used for 1b).

In some languages, the relevant forms may be referred to as nominalizations or converbs.

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is at least one such nonfinite form, which is specialized on the relativization of one of these arguments. If one participle can relativize S/A, P, and S/P, the answer is '0'.
