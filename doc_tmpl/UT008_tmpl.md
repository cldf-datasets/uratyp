Non-finite clauses can differ from finite clauses as regards core argument marking. For instance, in Meadow Mari, the genitive case can be used to mark S/A:

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT008-1)

## Coding

The value is '1' if the S/A argument of the non-finite clause is marked using a case not commonly associated with the respective argument in finite clauses. In Mari example, the genitive is used (in finite clauses the nominative case occurs).
