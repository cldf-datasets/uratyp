In addition to the types covered in questions UT055 and UT056, it is possible to find participles that can relativize 
some noncore participants but not necessarily all or some core participants. For instance, in Beserman Udmurt there is 
a participle ending in *-n*, which can be used to relativize instrumentals and direct objects (P) (1a and 1b, respectively), 
but not subjects (S/A) ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:shagal_overview_2018): 74).

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1b&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT057-1b)

In some languages, the relevant forms may be referred to as nominalizations or converbs.

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is at least one such participle that can relativize some noncore participants but cannot relativize all or some core participants.
