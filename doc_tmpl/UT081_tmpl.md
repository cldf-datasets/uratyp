# [](ParameterTable?__template__=property.md&property=Name#cldf:UT081)

This question specifically asks for a genitive case that is marked with an affix, as in example (1). 

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT081-1)

To compare, the Estonian genitive forms only reveal the root vowel.

## Coding

The answer is '1' only if there is an affix.
