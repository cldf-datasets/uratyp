Languages that allow grammatical categories to occur on the negative marker (typically called *negative auxiliary*) differ as to which grammatical categories can be expressed on the negative auxiliary and which on the lexical verb. This question investigates, whether aspect can occur on the negative marker. For instance, in negative constructions in Nganasan the iterative suffix *-kǝ* and habitual suffix *-muŋha* (both derivational) appear on the negative auxiliary (Gusev 2015: 107).

## Coding

The value is '1' if aspect can be expressed overtly on the negative marker. The value is '0' if there is an aspectual auxiliary construction but no aspectual marker can appear on the negative marker.
