Possessive marking may be used to encode the subject of the respective relative clause. For instance, in Finnish the 
agentive participial (*-ma*) is used to express the subject, as in (1). Such marking of the subject can be seen as an 
indication of non-finiteness of participles ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:shagal_overview_2018)).

## Coding

The value is '1' if a possessive suffix encoding the subject can attach to a participle. The value is '0' in the case there are no possessive suffixes in a language or a possessive suffix occurs in some other position (e.g. on the head noun).
