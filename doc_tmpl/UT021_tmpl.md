Pluperfect is used to locate a situation in the past prior to a reference point that is also in the past, thus, it can 
be regarded as 'past in the past'. ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:comrie_1985): 65). 
Whereas in example (1) the referece point is established by the subordinate clause, in example (2) it becomes clear from 
the context that an action was completed by a certain point in the past. Past perfects may be realised by periphrastic 
(1) or by synthetic means (2).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a dedicated pluperfect device, either periphrastic or synthetic.
