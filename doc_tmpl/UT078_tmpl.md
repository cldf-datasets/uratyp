The same way as case inventories can vary in a language (from two to dozens) different words or word classes may display 
different number of cases, e.g. nouns may distinguish more cases than adjectives ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:bickel_and_nichols_inflection_2009): 210). 
The aim of this question is to find out whether pronouns stand out by revealing case categories not found with other 
word classes (e.g. with nouns or adjectives). To exemplify, the accusative case in Finnish is only used with pronouns, 
e.g. cf. the case marking of *sin√§* 'you' and *kirja* 'book':

## Coding

The answer is '1' if pronouns reveal a case category that cannot be find with other word classes, otherwise the answer is '0'.
