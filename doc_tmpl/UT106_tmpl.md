Animacy distinction in independent interrogative pronouns means that a language distinguishes between animates ('who') 
vs. inanimates ('what'). The category animates usually involves humans and animals. However, a distinction can also be 
made between humans vs. non-humans. For example, in Mansi, *xoonxa*/*xotjut* means 'who' and is used for humans, 
whereas *man√µr* means 'what' and is used for animals and inanimate objects ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:riese_vogul_2001)).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a distinction between 'who' and 'what'. The distinction humans vs. non-humans is also counted as '1'.
