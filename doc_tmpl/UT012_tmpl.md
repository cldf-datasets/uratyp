The marking of the object may depend on a verb form (see also UT010 and UT011), e.g. the imperative, impersonal or negative form of a verb may require an object in a particular case. In Estonian, the imperative verb form takes the object in the nominative (1a), whereas with negation the partitive marking is used (1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if the verb conjugation form can have an affect on the case selection of the object (as in Estonian). When answering the question, only finite forms were considered; object conjugation was not considered.
