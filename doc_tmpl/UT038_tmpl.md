The aim of this question is to find out whether it is possible to use an impersonal form (may be called *passive*) in the finite paradigm instead of a finite form. In Veps (1), an impersonal form can appear in the 3rd person plural, whereas in Finnish this is possible in the 1st person plural (2). Both examples combine with as overt subject and are instances of active voice.

## Coding

The value is '1' if using an impersonal (passive) form is possible at least in one of the plural forms (i.e. 1PL, 2PL and/or 3PL). Only instances of impersonal (passive) form used with an overtly expressed subject/agent (as in Veps and Finnish) count as '1'.
