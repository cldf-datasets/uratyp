Nonfinite forms can be found in various functions. This question asks whether it is possible that one and the same form 
appears as a participial and as an action nominalization (see 1a and 1b, respectively). For an overlap between the form 
functioning as a participle and as agentive nominalization, see UT064.

## Coding

The value is '1' if a nonfinite form can be used both as a participle and as an agentive nominalization without any additional morphology.
