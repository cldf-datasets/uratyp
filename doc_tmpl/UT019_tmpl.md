Future time reference (FTR) may be expressed in several ways. One option is to use the present tense form of the lexical 
verb and deduce the future meaning from the context. For example, a temporal adverb (such as 'tomorrow', 'next year') may 
give rise to a future reading; aspectual relations may also play a role. Usage of the present tense for FTR is common, 
for instance, in Hungarian:

## Coding

The value is '1' if FTR is commonly expressed by means of the verb in the present tense form. If a language has a dedicated 
future marker (an inflection, auxiliary or derivation), the answer is usually '0'.
