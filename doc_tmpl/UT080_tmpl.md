It is common for the word meaning ‘1’ to assign singular number to its sister noun, whereas with words expressing higher 
values plural number (or dual) can be expected (cross-lingistically this applies at least to numbers up to '10') 
([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:hurford_numerals_2003): 582). However, there are also languages that can assign singular number to all its sister nouns. 
This is true, for instance, to Komi-Zyrian, e.g.:

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT080-1)

## Coding

The value is '1' if the noun can appear in the singular form also with numerals bigger than '1' (as in Komi-Zyrian example above). This also applies to languages where the numeral '2' is marked for dual but in other cases the singular marking is used. The value is '0' if singular marking is not commonly used with numerals bigger than '1'.
