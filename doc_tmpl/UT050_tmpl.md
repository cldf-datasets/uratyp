Standard negation stands for the negation of declerative verbal main clauses. Distinction can be made between symmetric 
and asymmetric negation. Whereas in the case of symmetric negation the affirmative and negative clauses only differ by 
the negative marker, asymmetric negation differs in other ways too, e.g. negation may affect the finiteness of verbal 
elements, marking of grammatical categories, reality status of events etc. ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:miestamo_wals_2013)). 
Both systems can co-occur in a language. For example, in Livonian, plural forms only differ in terms of the negative 
marker (= symmetric negation), while singular forms additionally reveal differences in person marking (= asymmetric negation) 
([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:metslang_et_al_2015): 435), cf. examples (1a) and (1b). The aim of this question is to examine the occurrence of 
asymmetric standard negation in the present tense.

## Coding

The answer is '1' if in the present tense the standard negation is asymmetric in at least some part of the negative paradigm (as is the case with Livonian). The answer is '0' if in the present tense the standard negation can only be symmetric.
