Nonfinite forms can be used in various functions, including as converbs. A converb can be defined as "a nonfinite verb 
form whose main function is to mark adverbial subordination"; whereas converbs could be seen as verbal adverbs, 
participles could be regarded as verbal adjectives ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:haspelmath_coverb_1995): 3). 
This question asks whether one and the same nonfinite form can be used in both functions. (Converbs may be subsumed 
under different labels, e.g. in Udmurt they are typically called gerunds.)

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a nonfinite form that can function both as a participle and as a converb without any additional morphological material.
