Adpositions supplement the case system by providing extra ways of expressing temporal, spatial, and other types of relationship, e.g. in the Hungarian example (1a) *mellett* expresses a spatial relationship. Adpositions also share several characteristics with cases, for instance, they may be used as roots to which personal suffixes are attached. This question examines weather person/number marking is possible on adpositions, as in (1b) and (1c).

## Coding

The answer is '1' if personal suffixes can be attached to adpositional roots. If this is not possible, the answer is '0'.
