A common voice distinction is between active vs. passive. Certain kind of opposition can be, however, better described 
as a distinction between personal vs. impersonal voice (see also [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:blevins_passives_2003)). 
Although the communicative function of passive and impersonal may be similar, the respective constructions show 
differences in their underlying morphosyntax. Whereas the passive is a valency-reducing operation, as a result of 
impersonalization no constituent is promoted to the subject position (argument realization is constrained) and valency 
of the verb is preserved, e.g. see (1a). Furthermore, impersonalization can also involve intransitive verbs such as 
‘to be’, ‘to live’ (1b).

## Coding

The value is '1' if the passive meaning can be expressed by an impersonal construction (valency of the verb is preserved, also used with intransitive verbs).
