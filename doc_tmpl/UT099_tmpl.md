Inflection is a type of word-formation, which is realized by means of affixes attached to stems. Nominal inflection 
concerns word-formation of nouns, such as inflection for case, e.g. 'friend' in Finnish inflects as follows: 
*ystävä* (Nom) : *ystävä-n* (Gen) : *ystävää* (Prt) etc. In addition to case inflection, there may also be possessive 
inflection e.g. Finnish *ystävä-ni* translates as 'my friend', *ystävä-si* 'your friend'. This question examines whether 
nouns reveal any other types of inflection. For instance, in Erzya, there is difference between definite and indefinite inflection of nouns:

[](ExampleTable?example_id=1b&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:UT099-1b)

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a definite inflection (as in Erzya) or any other type of nominal inflection different from the basic and possessive inflection. In other cases, the value is '0'.
