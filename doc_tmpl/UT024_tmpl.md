Mirativity is a grammatical category used to denote new, unexpected, and/or surprising situations. Although mirativity 
may be viewed as a subcategory of evidentiality (inferentiality) as it often arises as an extension of evidentiality, 
there are also reasons to view it in its own right: 
(i) unexpected situation is not necessarily inferred; 
(ii) it may also emerge as an extension of tense or mood ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:oudb_ob-ugric_2017)). 
Mirativity is regarded as a separate category in North Mansi, where it is shown to have evolved through desubordination 
(see [](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:skribnik_complex_2005)). In Khanty dialects, the categories of evidentiality 
and mirativity reveal different origins ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:nikolaeva_semantics_1999)).

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a separate marker to denote new, unexpected, and/or surprising situations. Both synthetic as well as analytic means count in the case they reveal a dedicated use.
