Special negative non-finite forms are forms that can be considered as inherently negative. In such cases, the affixes 
cannot be analysed in a straightforward way as the respective affirmative marker + a negative marker. In Northern Khanty, 
for instance, there are two affirmative participles, the non-past participle in *-ti* and past participle in *-m*, and 
they are both negated by the form in *-li* (1).

The Finnish negative participle in *-maton* is diachronically *-ma* + nominal negator *-ton* (cf. *asunto* ‘apartment’ + *-ton = asunnoton* ‘the one without an apartment’), but it also has many idiosyncratic features, e.g. it can negate all participles (e.g. *koskaan kuolematon rakkaus* ‘the love that never dies’), including the agentive participle in *-ma*. Therefore, it can be regarded as a special negative non-finite form.

## Coding

The value is '1' if a language has inherently negative non-finite forms as described above.
