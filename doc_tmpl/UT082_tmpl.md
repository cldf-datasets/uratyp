The dative case is often found to express recipients, benefatives/malefactives, experiencers, goals, and purposes; 
structurally datives tend to be associated with ditransitive indirect objects ([](Source?ref&with_internal_ref_link#cldf:naess_dative_2009): 572-573). 
In various languages, the dative domain can be subdivided differently. 
This question asks whether there is a separate case (usually called *the dative*) used to express these meanings. 
For instance Livonian has both local cases and the dative case (1).

To compare, in Estonian, the allative case (a local case) is used in both functions, e.g. *minu-le* (1SG-ALL) 
‘to me’, *põranda-le* (floor-ALL) 'onto the floor'. 

## Coding

The value is '1' if there is a separate dative case. If dative functions are expressed by other cases (e.g. local cases) or there is no separate dative case, the value is '0'.
